### DIAMOND EDUCATION

4 C’S OF DIAMOND
  
  

#### Colour

  

For white or colourless diamonds (as opposed to coloured diamonds, which is a whole different story), the diamond industry has adopted an alphabetical colour scale from D to Z, with D as the highest grading. As you go down the scale, the diamond starts to develop a yellow or brown tint.

Experts in the world of diamonds determine the colour by comparing a diamond against a master set of diamonds of different colours. Without comparing diamonds side by side, it is very difficult to see the difference between a D and a G.

Completely colourless diamonds (such as D and E) are much rarer than others which is why they come with a higher pricing premium. The key question is always where to draw the line when choosing the colour of a diamond - how far can you compromise colour before the diamond is too tinted? The answer to this question is relative to your budget and quality expectations.

  

#### Fancy colour

  

Although exceptionally rare, natural fancy coloured diamonds of all colours can be found in nature – from red (the most rare and valuable) to pink, blue, green, orange, green, yellow and brown. These fancy coloured diamonds lie outside the white [colour range](http://www.diamonds27.com/fourcs/diamond-colour-tutorial) and are extremely rare and valuable. There is only one natural fancy coloured diamond discovered for every 10,000 colourless diamonds.

  
  

#### Clarity

  
  

Clarity, sometimes referred to as purity, is a combination of how many inclusions occur within a diamond, their overall positioning and their visual prevalence on the stone’s overall look. These inclusions are what distinguish a diamond from every other diamond. While grading a diamond’s clarity, the following qualities are considered:

  
  

-   Size - How small or large is the inclusion?
    
-     
    
-   Position - Where in the stone is the inclusion?
    
-     
    
-   Color - How light or dark is the inclusion?
    
-     
    
-   Number - How many inclusions are there in the diamond?
    
-     
    
-   Relief - How thick or thin is the inclusion?
    
-     
    
-   Nature - What type of inclusion is it?
    

  

#### Carat

  

Diamond Carat Weight Measures a Diamond’s Apparent Size.

Diamond carat weight is the measurement of how much a diamond weighs. A metric “carat” is defined as 200 milligrams.

Each carat can be subdivided into 100 ‘points.’ This allows very precise measurements to the hundredth decimal place. A jeweler may describe the weight of a diamond below one carat by its ‘points’ alone. For instance, the jeweler may refer to a diamond that weighs 0.25 carats as a ‘twenty-five pointer.’ Diamond weights greater than one carat are expressed in carats and decimals. A 1.08 carat stone would be described as ‘one point oh eight carats.’

  

#### CUT

  

A diamond cut is a style or design guide used when shaping a diamond for polishing. Cut does not refer to the shape of a stone (pear, oval etc.), but rather the symmetry, parameters and polishing quality of the diamond. The cut of a diamond greatly impacts your diamond’s look and associated shimmer suggesting that the better the cut quality of your diamond, the m ore luminous it will appear to the naked eye.

  

When admiring a diamond, a novel eye is less likely to catch the quality of the diamond’s cut. Therefore, one should look closely at the shimmer and shine of the stone to judge the quality of its cut. Simply put, select the diamond that looks most appealing face up to the naked eye.

The most important characteristic of a diamond is its cut. This is an integral part of determining its brilliance. Even a perfect diamond can appear dull if the cut is poor.

  
  
  

#### SHAPE

  

#### ROUND BRILLIANT CUT

The round brilliant cut diamond is the most popular shape of diamond. For hundreds of years, diamond cutters have been working with this cut to maximize its brilliance and fire. While this cut offers great flexibility within the four C’s, you will want to select higher quality grades to bring out the most brilliance within a round diamond.

  

#### PRINCESS CUT

Princess cut diamonds are exceptionally brilliant because of the way they are cut and are available in both square and rectangular shapes. The color that is emitted from princess cut diamonds is very unique. While the color of other diamond is displayed mainly in the center, the princess cut diamonds show distinct color in each of the corners as well.

  

#### MARQUISE CUT

A marquise cut diamond is a perfect shape for maximizing carat weight by emphasizing the size of the diamond. Its unique shape creates the effect of longer, more slender hands and fingers. The outline of a diamond is determined by its length to width ratio, which also provides an image of the shape and look of the diamond.

  

#### CUSHION CUT

Sometimes called a pillow-cut diamond, the cushion cut is a timeless cut that has earned its name for its pillow shape. Cushion cut diamonds tend to have impeccable brilliance and clarity in their appearance which can be attributed to their rounded corners and larger facets. These diamonds are available in square and rectangular shapes.

  

#### EMERALD CUT

Emerald cut diamonds have a unique optical appearance because of the rectangular facets step-cut into the diamond’s pavilion. This cut showcases the diamond’s original clarity beautifully because of its large rectangular table which will also make inclusions and color more apparent.

  

#### RADIANT CUT

Perfect for those looking for a unique style, radiant cut diamonds feature uniquely trimmed corners which combines the lines of an emerald cut with the brilliance of a round diamond. The sparkle of this diamond cut looks beautiful when combined with a variety of other diamond cuts.

  

#### PEAR SHAPED

Combining round and marquise cuts, the teardrop style of pear shaped diamonds is exceptional. The slender pear shape will give fingers and hands a slimmer appearance while creating a soft and delicate look. Pear shaped diamonds are cut to produce maximum brilliance, so it’s important to look for excellent symmetry.

  

#### OVAL CUT

Oval cut diamonds have a classic appearance with a modern twist! It is a popular cut in all types of jewelry, especially in [engagement rings](https://www.wixonjewelers.com/collection/engagement/), making it easy to match with other jewelry. It has an incredible brilliance, similar to the round brilliant cut, but also has the advantage of accentuating long, slender finders.

  

#### ASSCHER CUT

Asscher cut diamonds are often mistaken for an emerald cut because of its similar cut style; however an asscher is square rather than rectangular. Created in the early 1920s, the asscher cut has recently resurged in popularity, especially amongst celebrities.
